    <p><Font Face="Times New Roman">Janmashtami, also known as Krishna Janmashtami or Gokulashtami, is a major Hindu festival celebrating the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu. It is observed on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight) in the Hindu month of Bhadrapada, typically in August or September. Krishna, revered as a symbol of love, compassion, and divine joy, was born to free the world from evil and restore righteousness.<br><br>The festival is marked by fervent devotion, with temples and homes beautifully decorated in honor of Krishnaâ€™s birth. Devotees fast throughout the day, offering prayers, singing bhajans, and performing dances that narrate the life and leelas (divine plays) of Krishna. At midnight, the exact time of his birth, a special ceremony is performed, symbolizing the moment Krishna appeared to vanquish evil forces.<br><br>One of the highlights of Janmashtami is the Dahi Handi tradition, where groups of people form human pyramids to break an earthen pot filled with curd, reminiscent of young Krishna's playful love for butter. The festival brings communities together, fostering a sense of unity and devotion, and serves as a reminder of the eternal triumph of good over evil.</p>
