    <p Font Face="Times New Roman">Holi, known as the Festival of Colors, is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrated primarily in India and Nepal, marking the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. Typically observed in March, Holi brings together people of all ages and backgrounds in a joyous celebration. The festivities begin with Holika Dahan, a ceremonial bonfire symbolizing the burning of the demoness Holika, signifying the triumph of devotion and righteousness. The following day, revelers throw colored powders and water at each other, creating a lively and colorful atmosphere. This playful exchange not only represents joy and love but also fosters social harmony and the renewal of friendships. Traditional sweets like gujiya and bhang-infused delicacies are enjoyed, adding to the festive spirit. Holi also encourages forgiveness and the strengthening of relationships, as people come together to celebrate, often forgetting past grievances. In recent years, Holi has transcended regional boundaries, with celebrations occurring worldwide, drawing people from diverse backgrounds to participate. The festival's essence lies in its ability to unite communities, promote joy, and herald the arrival of spring, making it a cherished occasion that resonates with the spirit of togetherness and renewal.</p>
