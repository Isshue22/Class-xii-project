    <p><Font Face="Times New Roman">Kali Puja, also known as Shyama Puja, is a major Hindu festival dedicated to the worship of Goddess Kali, the fierce and powerful manifestation of the divine feminine. Celebrated primarily in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, and other parts of Eastern India, it takes place on the new moon night of the Hindu month of Kartik, coinciding with Diwali. Kali symbolizes strength, empowerment, and the destruction of evil forces, often depicted with dark skin, multiple arms, and fierce expressions, standing over Lord Shiva.<br><br>The rituals of Kali Puja involve elaborate offerings, including flowers, sweets, meat, and fish, alongside the lighting of lamps and chanting of mantras. Devotees seek Kali's blessings for protection, success, and liberation from negativity. Temples and homes are adorned with lights and decorations, and cultural programs such as music and dance performances often accompany the spiritual activities.<br><br>Unlike the more celebratory nature of Diwali in other parts of India, Kali Puja holds a more somber and intense spiritual significance. It reflects the victory of good over evil, offering a reminder of the cyclical nature of creation and destruction. Through Kali's worship, devotees are reminded to confront their fears and inner darkness with courage and devotion.</p>
